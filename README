UNMAINTAINED
------------

This project is no longer actively maintained. I haven't used Proxool myself since 2006 and no longer even use Java. If the project has any chance of survival at all it would need to find a new maintainer. If anyone can recommend a good alternative I would be happy to mention it here. Alternatively, if anyone wants to contribute to this project then please create a pull request.

A Java SQL Driver that provides a connection pool wrapper around another
Driver of your choice. Very simple to migrate existing code. Fully
configurable. Fast, mature and robust. Transparently adds connection
pooling to your existing JDBC driver.

You can take a look at BUILD.txt, CHANGES.txt and LICENCE.txt but you might
have better luck looking at the documentation at doc/index.html.

I would welcome any comments you would like to make on Proxool. Good or
bad.
